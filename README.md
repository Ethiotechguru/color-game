# Color Game
JS color game New Repo
## My First Project at GA SEI Program.
I was excited to take this challenge knowing I will learn more and solidify what I have learned already.
The first step I took to build this game was to get set up the main component of the game with html. then try to get the game working using Java script. styling will come last.

This game will have three levels to challenge the player. The first step will contain 9 circle each with different color
which are generated randomly using the rgb values (0-255). the player will click on the circle until the clicked color is matched
the displied rgb(values). when the player clicked the correct color, all 8 circle will change to the picked color and the player
will be prompted to play the game again or move to the next level.
the second level will have 12 circle with 12 shade of colors and the player will be challenged to play the same way. 
the third and the last level shows only one color which is randomly generated and the player will be prompted to input the
rgb numerical value to match the color displayed. if the player missed on first attempt, they will be provided one channel
rgb value and prompted to try again. if the player did not get it on the second try, they will be provided the second channel
value and prompted to try the third time. if the player still not able to get the correct values, the rgb(value) for all
three channel will be displayed on the screen and the player will be given a chance to enter the given value.
